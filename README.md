This project is a clone of Stake's crash game.
Here's the main benefit of this project:
It could be used by twitch streamers to
make it seem as if they're gambling real money
on Stake.com, but it's just a clone. Thus,
those without the financial means to become
a gambling streamer can accomplish it through
this fake app.

This app is, however, still a work in progress. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
then
### `npm start`
